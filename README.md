# TRAJECTORIES-OF-PLANETS-AND-SATELLITES-AROUND-A-STAR-SYSTEM

Masters Project: Using Advanced Numerical techniques to simulate the motion of planets around a star, along with that of a satellite around the planet. 

This program computes the trajectories of the planets and their respective satellites and help us understand the nature of their orbits. We have also computed those trajectories by varying:
1. The radius of planets
2. The orbital velocities of the planets
3. The mass of the star itself (sun)

This work provides us with a better understanding of how planetary motions might work. We have also evaluated the total energy of the system, as well as the potential of it. 
It explores various numerical techniques to solve the second order differential equations, like Trapezoidal method,  Simpson 1/3rd and 3/8th method, Runge-Kutta 4th order method, etc.
